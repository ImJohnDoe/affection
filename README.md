# affection
Say what matters! Give hearts to show what you appreciate about those around you. Keep on your phone privately forever.

Knowing what matters to your family, friends or even your spouse takes effort. Strengthen your relationships by intentionally identifying what kinds of interactions are meaningful to you.

Project Affection is about communicating what really matters to you. A central focus is ease of use. As such, it is implemented as an iMessage extension. In addition, privacy is yours. Your data stays between you and those you care about and not third parties.

## How to Run

1. open with xcode
1. build as iMessage extension
